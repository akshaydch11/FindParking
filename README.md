Find Parking

In this project, I have used google maps android v2 api and google places api to find out nearest parking lots.

For building your own application which uses maps on android and google places, you need to generate keys on "google api console" and then use it in application.

For using, google places you need "Browser API key" android key doesnot work here.
Tutorial how to generate browser key : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

You can change the value of key "AppConstants.PLACE_TO_LOOK" if your application need to search different types places like restaurants, amusements_park etc in search results. Supported keywords are available on https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/supported_types.
